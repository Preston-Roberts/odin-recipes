    <h2>Delicious looking double cheeseburger!</h2>
    <p>I love cheeseburgers. They are simple to make and absolutely delicious!</p>
    <p>Cheeseburgers are the first food I learned to cook on the grill</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pounds of ground beef per burger (example: 4 burgers 2 pounds ground beef)</li>
        <li>2-3 pieces of bacon per burger.</li>
        <li>1 Bun per burger</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Toppings as desired. (Cheese, Mayonnaise, Tomatoes, Lettuce, etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat grill to 320 - 360 degrees fahrenheit</li>
        <li>While grill is heating up measure out ground beef patties 1/4th lbs per patty 2 patties per burger</li>
        <li>Squeeze ground beef with hands into a rough ball like shape and use palms to flatten patty to desired thickness</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper both sides of patties</li>
        <li>Cook Bacon</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For Pan cook the bacon over medium-high heat flipping as needed final product should be completely brown with no translucense</li>
            <li>For Griddle cook the bacon at 350 degrees flipping as needed final product should be completely brown with no translucense</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Put patties on grill flip at 5-6 minute mark</li>
        <li>Check temp 3 minutes after flipping (Goal temperature for medium is 145 farenheit or about 155 for little to no pink anymore and your burger will be dry!)</li>
        <li>Check temp as needed remember our goal of 145 - 155 fahrenheit
        <li>When you are 3-5 degrees away from your final temp add cheese</li>
        <li>Once cheese is melted take burgers off grill and let rest for 2 minutes (DO NOT SKIP. If you skip the resting stage you will let all the juice out of your burger when you take a bite!)</li>
        <li>Assemble and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
